# InlineAnnotation

This software reads a folder with plain documents, annotates them using the TARSQI toolkit and transforms the output to an inline format. The value atribute is also normalized to a "YYYY-MM-DD" format.

Note that is needed to have python installed for TARSQI to run properly. Also the creation of an environment variable INLINEANNOTATION to the root folder of the project is needed. The folder to process must be an argument.
